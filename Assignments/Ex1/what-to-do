1.  This is what needs to be done to get the assignment done.
    Create elevator class, needs to have a constructor with all things in the dict.
    Add all the function to make the elevator work.

2.  Create Building class, needs to have a constructor that gets a json file.
    Make function that take json file and converts into dict that you can use as info, for the constructor,
    so the constructor gets building size, min and max floor and a list of elevators in it, which will need to
    be created.
    After that we will have a building class and elevator class, we can make an algorithm for allocating
    an elevator for a call. def allocate(call_file).
    So we can reach into the building elevator list and use all the info from the elevators and make our
    allocate work with that info.
    I want the allocate to work directly with an elevator, meaning, once we get an elevator which suits the call
    the allocate will add a command to that elevator. We will have to see how we track the commands so the elevators
    keep doing their jobs.

#   we need to finish building the times functions, which will help us allocate the right elevator and then we are
    basically done.
    What time functions do we have? What do we want to do? How do we want to track all the the time changes?
    Lets make a decision and just get to work on it.

3.  Lastly we need to connect it all together and make the main function use the Ex1,input,output.
    Ex1: is where our main algo is and will allocate the elevator and make the elevator move.
    Input: that is the calls we get as a csv.
    Output: looks exactly like the calls just has an allocation to each call.
    We have to calculate the time it takes for the total call to get to its stops and for the the average waiting time.
